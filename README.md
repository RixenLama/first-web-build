# first-web-build
This will be my first ever time making a website. 


I used Figma for the web layout. 

I use Vs code for the coing part. 
I used the following languages: 
-HTML
-SASS
-JS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To open the website laytout, you have to download the file and open it via Figma.

I decided that this project had failed, since the code was clustered with mess.
I will make a new Project instead. 
I have learned the value of neat code.
